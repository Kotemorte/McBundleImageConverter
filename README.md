# McBundleImageConverter
Allows you to batch process images into Bundles! (Gif support too!)

In order to use this, you should get a folder together of the textures you want to use named with their item ID in the game.
Why? Well you can make this work with ANY resource pack!
So you can get a resource pack together for full colors and get this running. :P
